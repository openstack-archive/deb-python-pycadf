This library provides an auditing data model based on the `Cloud Auditing Data
Federation <http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf>`_ specification, primarily for
use by OpenStack. The goal is to establish strict expectations about what
auditors can expect from audit notifications.

Developer documentation, the source of which is in ``doc/source/``, is
published at:
