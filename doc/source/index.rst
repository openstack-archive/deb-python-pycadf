 PyCADF developer documentation
===============================

The `CADF (Cloud Audit Data Federation Working Group)`_ is working to develop
open standards for audit data which can be federated from cloud providers,
with the intent to elevate customerâ€™s trust in cloud hosted applications.

Specifications and profiles produced by the CADF will help protect the
investments of companies seeking to move their applications to cloud
deployment models and preserve their ability to audit operational processes,
regardless of their chosen cloud provider. The CADF develops specifications
for audit event data and interface models and a compatible interaction model
that will describe interactions between IT resources for cloud deployment models.

pyCADF is the python implementation of the CADF specification

This documentation offers information on how CADF works and how to
contribute to the project.
